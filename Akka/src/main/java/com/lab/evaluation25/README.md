## Description of message flows

The main allocates the various actors and sends them the ConfigMsg, this message sets the balancer for the client and the two workers for the balancer.
The main also sends the Rest/ResumeMsg to workers to change their status.

The client receives the PutMsg and the GetMsg, redirecting them to the balancer with an ask pattern only for the GetMsg.
The client also receives two type of responses: ReplyMsg and TimeoutMsg generated by the balancer.

The balancer after receiving the PutMsg and GetMsg redirects them to the workers following the specification of the assignment, the PutMsg becomes a StoreMsg where it is indicated if the store is for the primary memory.
If the balancer does not receives any ReplyMsg from the workers it send back to the client a TimeoutMsg.

The workers, if they are awake, after the search of the email send back a ReplyMsg with the correct email, or "Not found" if it is missing.
